      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Bangladeshi cuisine is a culinary art-form. A taste tantalizing blend of wonderful and fragrant spices that will
        keep you coming back for more.
      <p>
        Many non-Bangladeshis have probably eaten Bangladeshi food without knowing it. For example, over 80 percent of
        the “Indian” restaurants in the U.K. are operated by people of Bangladeshi origin and will serve Bangladeshi
        food.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you loved it, it was probably Bangladeshi. <br>

        Bengali cooking is also known for its wide array of sweets made from milk. Rasho-gollah, kalo-jam, shandesh,
        mishti doi, shemai, chamcham … the names go on and on.

        I love my Kormas. Most of all I love Bangladeshi Kormas, which tend to be lightly spiced but heavily flavored.
        We do not put a lot of heavy cream like the Indian version but prefer onions and ghee to give the creaminess. I
        came across this recipe in the New York Times via Shama Mubdi. This is supremely easy to make. Stir it all in
        and cook. The flavors are authentic.

        This is a variation of similar recipes you might see elsewhere that uses panch phoron (the Bengali five spice
        mix). I’ve simplified this recipe to use only three instead of the five and perhaps I should trademark my teen
        phoron (three spice mix) for posterity.

        This mutton curry is very traditional in every home of Bangladesh. This village-style recipe consists of very
        common spices avoiding use of a lot of spices for easy and fast cooking.
